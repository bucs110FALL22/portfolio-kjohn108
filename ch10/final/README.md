# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION 
The program pulls data from an api that contains the conversation rates from many different currencies into bitcoin. I use the conversion rate to find number of bitcoin, then I use the other api that has the total number of bitcoin in existance to find percent of bitcoin. 
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS
If you put in a really small number like 1 then it will return 0 bitcoin because it rounds.
